# 📚 Research Paper Management & Analysis Intelligence System (GenAI)

An **end-to-end AI-powered research intelligence platform** that helps researchers, students, and R&D teams **ingest, organize, search, summarize, and analyze academic research papers** using **LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector search, citation analysis, and research analytics**.

This project mirrors real-world **academic search engines and research intelligence platforms** used by universities, research labs, and applied AI teams.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The rapid growth of scientific literature across domains such as **AI, healthcare, physics, finance, and social sciences** has made it difficult for researchers to:

- Discover relevant papers efficiently  
- Track citations and related work  
- Understand papers without reading them end-to-end  
- Identify emerging research trends over time  

This system addresses these challenges by combining **Document AI**, **semantic search**, and **LLM-powered reasoning** into a single research assistant.
